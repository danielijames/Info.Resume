		<h3> It's a pleasure to meet you. </h3><br>
		<p> I am Daniel James. Chattanooga has been my home for almost 4 years. During my tenure here I have been a student intern at the local electric company - The Tennessee Valley Authority - where I have collaborated with a small team of electrical engineers. I study at <strong>The University of Tennessee Chattanooga</strong> the degree path <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong>. Luckily, my engineering courses introduced me to coding through microsoft's language Excel: VBA. After my introduction to coding I craved to know more and do more with it. I've learned through my own studies that VBA is very similar to Javascript. I've also taught myself, with the help of online instructional videos, how to program in CSS, HTML and Java. In my spare time I have just begun to shift focus onto backend developing but what you need to know is that I love it all. Coding excites me, it gives me the opportunity to create. It has awoken my inner artist.

		<h4> Why hire Daniel? </h4>

		I love to learn. My attitude is a "Can-do" attitude. I am of the small minority of fostered youth in Tennessee who have pursued college, thrived in a tough space and done so on the shear will to be successful. Because of this, I have a unique personality. One that I believe helps me relate to people, feel what they feel, see from their perspective and learn from them. When i'm in your office you'll know that I want to be there. <strong> No task is too small for me!</strong> I'll code the part you weren't looking forward to doing, i'll walk your dog, bring you coffee, sweep your desk area. I genuinely want to be part of your team in the best way that I can.
