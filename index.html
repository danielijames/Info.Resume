		<h3> It's a pleasure to meet you. </h3><br>
		<p> I am Daniel James. Chattanooga has been my home for almost 4 years. During my tenure here I have been a student intern at the local electric company - The Tennessee Valley Authority - where I have collaborated with a small team of electrical engineers. I study at <strong>The University of Tennessee Chattanooga</strong> the degree path <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong>. Luckily, my engineering courses introduced me to coding. I further my developement education through the purchase of online courses.

		<h4> Why hire Daniel? </h4>
		I love to learn. My attitude is a "Can-do" attitude. I am of the small minority of fostered youth in Tennessee who have pursued college, thrived in a tough space and done so on the shear will to be successful. Because of this, I have a unique personality. One that I believe helps me relate to people, feel what they feel, see from their perspective and learn from them. When i'm in your office you'll know that I want to be there. <strong> No task is too small for me!</strong> I genuinely want to be part of your team in the best way that I can. <br><br><br><hr>
